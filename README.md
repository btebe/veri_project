This is a simple full-stack project where i use react js, node js and Mysql. As you can tell, this is a login app where a user can either login or sign up for an account. In this project email verification is used in two cases when a user forgets their password and after the user registers for the first time. Also in this project, jsonwebtoken is used scarcely only for login authentication. Libraries used for this project: 

nodemailer, sequelize, jsonwebtoken, crypto, bcrypt, axios, react-router-dom, formik and yup.

i have deployed the back-end to heroku and the front-end to Netlify. For testing purposes, the email used in this project to send verification to the user is sent by this email: tebe.dev.co@gmail.com
